    <p>Good, Bad, or Ugly</p>

    <p>Recently came across a software company with over a dozen patent numbers listed at the bottom of their website. In looking at a few I noticed a pattern.</p>

    <p>The patent filing includes a beefy PDF specification thats around 40 pages long. The core idea is usually captured by the abstract and perhaps a single diagram. The rest of the PDF is filled in with many different use case examples, variations of the same diagram, and pages of text explaining each diagram.</p>

    <p>Most importantly I noticed that the core idea is very high-level. The specification is NOT nearly enough instruction to develop the actual thing. It takes considerable time and technical effort to take one of these ideas and create an actual working system.</p>

    <p>So i'm left wondering:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Do these patents exist to protect ideas that would otherwise be too easy to "steal" or re-invent independently?
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Is the idea worth more than the implementation? Perhaps, but implementation is hard, and there's almost always multiple ways of doing it, each way with pros and cons over others. There's so much room for competition just within implementation of the same idea.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                If I were to build a system similar to the one described in one of these patents - where is the line of infringement? What can be similar and what must be different?
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
