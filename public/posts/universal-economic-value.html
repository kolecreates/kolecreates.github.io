    <h2>Universal Economic Value</h2>

    <p>Solve puzzles - make money.</p>
    
    <p>I discover the <a href="https://arcprize.org/play" target="_blank">ARC-AGI challenge</a> a couple months ago.</p>
    <p>It is a challenging series of puzzles with human scores around 80% while the state-of-the-art algorithm has achieved only 43% as of August 2024.</p>

    <blockquote>
        ARC-AGI is explicitly designed to compare artificial intelligence with human intelligence. To do this, ARC-AGI explicitly lists the priors knowledge human have to provide a fair ground for comparing AI systems. These core knowledge priors are ones that humans naturally possess, even in childhood.
        ...
        ARC-AGI avoids a reliance on any information that isn’t part of these priors, for example acquired or cultural knowledge, like language.

    <p>Discovering ARC-AGI reminded me of a thought experiment I was obsessed with a few years ago. An idea of "Universl Econimic Value".</p>

    <p>Adjacent to universal basic income (UBI), UEV is where there is some way to capitilize on the basic value of human intelligence to give everyone some baseline economic worth.</p>

    <p>Physical labor is UEV historically, but we observe how wages stagnate while costs explode, and we also observe how labor, of all types, becomes automated overtime.</p>

    <p>ARC-AGI rekindled the idea by demonstrating there is still some fundamental disparity between human and machine intelligence.</p>
    
    <p>What if any human could earn a wage by completing small cognitive tasks within a larger information system. Similarly to how car manufacturing pipelines work - where there are big complicated machines doing large portions - alongside humans doing smaller more intricate segments.</p>
