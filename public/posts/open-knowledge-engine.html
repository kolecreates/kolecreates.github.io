    <h2>Open Knowledge Engine</h2>
    <p class="meta">Posted on August 13, 2024</p>

    <p>Like wikipedia but queryable, highly structured, programatically interactive.</p>
    <p>Like Wolfram Language but open source, open data, and a simpler interface.</p>

    <p>
        The schema of this database and query interface must be intuitive, and grow at a significantly slower rate than the data.
    If the schema and interface grow in complexity equal to the data - then it adds litte to no value.
    I'm not sure if it's possible to find a schema and interface that are static. I have to imagine at least in the beginning, 
    as data is added, new requirements of the schema and interface will be discovered frequently.

    <p>
        A semi-automated or fully-automated ingestion pipeline will be key to success. In comparison, Wolfram Language started development over 30 years ago.
        There is a massive amount of knowledge and it exists in an unstructured form or has a different structure.
        My hope is that scripts and language model technology can aid in the import of knowledge into the system from sources like Wikipedia, academic papers, 
        open source projects, text books, and more.

        Large language models are in some sense type of knowledge engine - just with a different architecture than imagined here.
        LLMs are neural, stochastic, evolved via gradient descent, tokens in and tokens out. This is a very powerful type of knowledge engine.
        However, the type of knowledge engine I'm talking about is more classical, built on a relational/graph database, with a query interface.
        The advantages of the classical type of knowledge engine is efficiency (speed, scale, energy), structure/determinism, and interpretability.
        The beauty is that both types of knowledge engines compliment one another.
